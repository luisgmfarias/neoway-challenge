# Data Pirates challenge

Welcome to Data Pirates challenge.


## Scenario:

Hello, we have one small adventure to explore your skills. In this task you have to scrapy data from one website and write results in one file. In this case you will get data from 'correios' website..


## Requirements:

*  Start URL : http://www.buscacep.correios.com.br/sistemas/buscacep/buscaFaixaCep.cfm
*  Get data at least two UFs, the more the better
*  For each UF, capture at least 200 records (when they exist).
*  Each record must contain a "localidade" and a "faixa de cep"
*  The output format is [JSONL](http://jsonlines.org)

## Delivery:

The code should be sent through github, with documentation how to run it.

## Pay atention:
 * There is no right answer, we want to see how you solve problems.
 * We work mainly with [Python 3](https://www.python.org) and [Go](https://golang.org/), but feel free to use any language you feel more confortable.
 * We use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) a lot, not required but is a plus.
 * Unit tests are cool.
 * Show us that you can use all the git good pratices.
 * Think in the quality of your code, maintenability, legibility and simplicity, avoid overengineering.
 * Its important we can execute your project, so make clear what steps we need to take to run your project.
